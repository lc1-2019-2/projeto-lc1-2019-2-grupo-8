%*****************************
% Specification of Radix sort with two total preorders 
%
% This theory contains a formalization of Radixsort for lists[T],
% where T is a non-interpreted type.  It sorts elements of type 
% T by two different total pre-orders (denoted as <= and <<)
% using as assumed stable sorting method mergesort.  The result
% is the input list sorted by the lexicographical order built
% from << and <=.
